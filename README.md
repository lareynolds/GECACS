# GECACS
## FSWG Guild Equipment Check-out and Control System (GECACS)
This project is being developed for the Fredericksburg Spinners and Weavers Guild.

## Issue
The guild librarian needs a way to track the guild's equipment. The guild has equipment stored at the studio and different member's homes. The librarian needs a way to track the piece of equipment when it is checked-out/in and to whom.

## Initial Thoughts
* Need a SQL database for the equipment, storage locations, members and check out/check in transactions
* A web interface for the members to check-out/in equipment and for the librarian to add or update inventory

## Implementation
* Non-SQL Database
* Python
* Wordpress

## Proposed Process
Use Chat GPT to guide me thought the development process. Document the development on GitHub and MyOrdinaryJourney.com
